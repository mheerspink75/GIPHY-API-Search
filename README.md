**Project:  Website with a Search Engine**

## Abstract:  
The main purpose of this project is to create a website with a search engine that can loop through GIPHY's API and display image results on the page. The full project requirements can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/project-2). 


## Workflow Requirements

### User Stories:

**1.** "As a student studying web development, I want a solution with a simple interface that can loop through the GIPHY API and display GIF image search results based on user input."  
*- Daniel*

**2.** "I post GIFs on my social media blog regularly, I want a simple interface that can search GIF APIs, display GIF images and provide links for sharing them."  
*- Laura*

### Wireframes:

**1.** First, I created a basic layout of the web and mobile interface design on CodePen.  
*The CodePen Reference Page can be found [here](https://codepen.io/mheerspink75/pen/wVYNmw?editors=1010).*

### Development Phase:

**1.** Created GitHub Repository  [GIPHY-API-Search](https://github.com/mheerspink75/GIPHY-API-Search).

**2.** Added [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to the project.

**3.** Obtained an API key through [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) website.

**4.** Created a responsive website using [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), added a collapsible [Bootstrap Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) and [Bootstrap Input Group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/). 

**5.** Added custom CSS and [Ruby SASS](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass), transpiled to SCSS, through a combination of the command line and configuring the Visual Studio Code extension [Live SASS Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass). Modified CSS to import [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+fonts&gs_ivs=1#tts=0).

**6.** Added working JavaScript code by referencing class materials and code examples found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

**7.** Modified JavaScript code to display search results to the webpage and worked on translating the working JavaScript to jQuery.

**8.** Published the GitHub Repository  [GIPHY-API-Search](https://github.com/mheerspink75/GIPHY-API-Search) to [GitHub Pages](https://page/s.github.com). The working website can be found [here](https://mheerspink75.github.io/GIPHY-API-Search/). 

**9.** Created a new CodePen to experiment with future feature additions [here](https://codepen.io/mheerspink75/pen/yLBOxoa).

#### Future Improvements:

**1.** The Bootstrap grid system was implemented in this project as a time-saving measure. This was a first attempt at creating a web site using Bootstrap. In the future I would like to refine the responsive elements.

**2.**  Bootstrap classes accounted for the majority of the styling on the page. I would also like to experiment more with converting Bootstrap classes to SCSS for customization.

**3.**  In addition to improving the future styling and responsive elements on this site, I will be working on refining my JavaScript and jQuery skills for creating web apps.
